### Peer Review


**Reviewer:** Chris Wells-Hott
 

**Reviewer Notes:** The App works. Maybe make the text color in the favorites list black so the user can see the favorites city names better. I not sure how to delete an item from the favorites list. When I scaled down to mobile the responiveness was not working. Other than that everything work good. Good work!!!
